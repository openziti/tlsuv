**HIGHLY UNSTABLE**

Chainable [libuv][0] streams.

## Why?

It is quite easy to write a TCP server/client in [libuv][0]. Writing HTTP
server/client is a bit harder. Writing HTTP server/client on top of TLS server
could be unwieldy.

`uv_link_t` aims to solve complexity problem that quickly escalates once using
multiple layers of protocols in [libuv][0] by providing a way to implement
protocols separately and chain them together in an easy and high-performant way
using very narrow interfaces.

## How?

_(NOTE: chain is built from links)_

_(NOTE: many of these API methods have return values, check them!)_

First, a `uv_stream_t*` instance needs to be picked. It will act as a source
link in a chain:
```c
uv_stream_t* stream = ...;

uv_link_source_t source;

uv_link_source_init(uv_default_loop(), &source, stream);
```

A chain can be formed with `&source` and any other `uv_link_t` instance:
```c
uv_link_t link;

static uv_link_methods_t methods = {
  .read_start = read_start_impl,
  .read_stop = read_stop_impl,
  .write = write_impl,
  .try_write = try_write_impl,
  .shutdown = shutdown_impl,
  .close = close_impl,

  /* These will be used only when chaining two links together */

  .alloc_cb_override = alloc_cb_impl,
  .read_cb_override = read_cb_impl
};

uv_link_init(&link, &methods);

/* Just like in libuv */
link.alloc_cb = my_alloc_cb;
link.read_cb = my_read_cb;

/* Creating a chain here */
uv_link_chain(&source, &link);

uv_link_read_start(&link);
```

Now comes a funny part, any of these method implementations may hook up into
the parent link in a chain to perform their actions:

```c
static int shutdown_impl(uv_link_t* link,
                         uv_link_t* source,
                         uv_link_shutdown_cb cb,
                         void* arg) {
  fprintf(stderr, "this will be printed\n");
  return uv_link_propagate_shutdown(link->parent, source, cb, arg);
}
```
